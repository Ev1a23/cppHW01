*When a thread runs after the timeout, it's being canceled immediately, without busy waiting, thanks to our implementation using pthread_cancel and condition variables.
*A special character 'T' will be written to the output file in case a thread is terminated, which implies the relvant run time exceeded the timeout.
*our general cmake file creates a folder named algo_dir which includes all of our algorithm's .so files.
