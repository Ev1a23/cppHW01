*Logging:
	We implemented a msgLog method to write to output.txt as well as stdout, and across our code there are many writes to stdout for logging purpose.

*Tester:
	As menetioned in pdf we designed a RobotTest class based on gtest, including 17 tests, our code is deterministic and that help us to test outputs.
	After using makefile from base dir, cd to tests folder, and after that compile the RobotTest.cpp using(maybe need to install using: sudo apt install libgtest-dev))
	g++ -std=c++20 -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic RobotTest.cpp -lgtest -lgtest_main -pthread -o robot_test -lstdc++fs
	after that, run with ./robot_test
